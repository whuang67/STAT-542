# STAT 443
## PM 2.5 Project

This is an on-going project, so far we are still performing data exploration. We found out that with the help of Shiny application, we can summarize too many complicated plots into one single page. You will be able to see it by clicking here(https://wenkehuang.shinyapps.io/stat443/). Username "group5" and password "group5" can help you have access to this app. 

If you have any good advice, please reach out to Wenke Huang [whuang67@illinois.edu].
