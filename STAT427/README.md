### Install

This project requires **R** and the following R libraries installed:

- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.org/)
- [gridExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html)
- [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)
- [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- [pROC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pROC/index.html)

I highly recommend you choose [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) which makes R easier to use and includes a code editor, debugging & visualization tools.
