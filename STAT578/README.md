### Install

This project requires **R** and the following R libraries installed:

- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.org/)
- [cranlogs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cranlogs/index.html)
- [nonlinearTseries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nonlinearTseries/index.html)
- [tsDyn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsDyn/index.html)

I highly recommend you choose [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) which makes R easier to use and includes a code editor, debugging & visualization tools.
